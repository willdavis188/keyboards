willd23 handwired numpad:

I followed u/Joe_Scotto tutorials as well as a guide by u/onebigdoor using 18 gauge bare copper wire. If you are interested in doing something similar then save yourself a massive headache and use magnet wire instead. Using 18 gauge wire instead of 16 gauge allows the wires to fit directly into the holes of the pro micro instead of having to solder the wire to breakout pins.

Some things I learned from this build:

- Use 18ga wire (I originally started with 16ga)
- Itâ€™s really really hard to solder copper wire to breakout pins
- Leaded solder is so much easier to work with
- Get a nice set of flush cutters
- The location of bends are a lot more forgiving than you would think
- Use flux when soldering
- 
Switches are Lubed and Filmed Gateron Milky Yellows with Oil King top housings.
